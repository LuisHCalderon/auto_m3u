Imagine you have many videos scattered across different folders and you want to channel surf instead of opening them one by one. This PowerShell code will help you create a "playlist.m3u" file for mp4 videos. Simply place the "CreatePlaylist.ps1" file in the folder you want, then right-click it, and run with PowerShell. Then open it with your favorite media player (such as mpv). The code respects the order of the folders in alphanumeric form. Greetings, Luis Calderon from Lima-Per√∫!
